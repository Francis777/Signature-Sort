packed_sort cpp:

I pack k b-bit numbers into a 64 bit number. w(64) = 2*k*(b+1).
You can call this function by this:
packed_sort(uint64_t a[],  int low, int cnt, int b)
According to the implementation problem, cnt can only be chosen 2^n. For example:
packed_sort(a, 0, N, 7);

What's more, radix_sort is also included in the radix_sort.cpp
